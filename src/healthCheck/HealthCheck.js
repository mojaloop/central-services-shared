 *
 * HealthCheck is a common class for handling health checks across multiple projects. If you wish to test
 * subservices as part of your health check, create a new HealthCheck, and pass in an array of serviceChecks.
 *
 * @example
 * //Construct a new HealthCheck, and pass through a package.json, and List of ServiceCheckerFuncs
 *
 * const packageJson = require('../package.json')
 * const serviceChecks = [
 *   //Implement these methods
 *   () => Promise.resolve({status: statusEnum.OK, service: serviceName.datastore }),
 *   () => Promise.resolve({status: statusEnum.OK, service: serviceName.broker }),
 * ]
 * const healthCheck = new HealthCheck(packageJson, serviceChecks)
 * const health = await healthCheck.getHealth()
